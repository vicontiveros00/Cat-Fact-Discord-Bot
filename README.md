# Cat facts!

Discord.js bot that returns a cat fact from the [MeowFacts API](https://meowfacts.herokuapp.com/) and sends it as a message to your server.

Will host soon.

### Usage

At root directory, create a `.env` file containing
- Desired port to run the bot
- Discord Bot token
- Discord Client ID

Run `npm start` at root to start the bot.

Will expand with more features if I can think of any
